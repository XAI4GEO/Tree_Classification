# Research workflow: Explainable few-shot learning workflow for detecting invasive and exotic tree species

This repository contains the code and data for the research work "Explainable few-shot learning workflow for detecting invasive and exotic tree species".

There are three components in this repository:

- `data_prepapration`: This folder contains the code for preparing the data for the research work, including getting candidate image cutouts, data cleaning, and generate training pairs.

- `training`: This folder contains the code for training the based model and the refinement model.

- `XAI`: This folder contains the code for testing the performance of the optimized model, and explaining the performance of the model.

The data used in this research work is vailabel on Zenodo, with DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.13380285](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13380285)
