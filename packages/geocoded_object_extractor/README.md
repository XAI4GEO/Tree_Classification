# Geocoded Object Extractor 

This tool provides the functionality to generate geocoded cutouts from a larger raster dataset and a list of object location information (bounding boxes or polygons), typically provided as vector data. Object locations can be associated with labels, as needed e.g. in image classification tasks.
